// Convert Paise To Rupees

/*

    Write a program that asks the user to enter the following:
	An integer representing the number of paise

	You may assume that the number of paise entered is greater than or equal to zero

	The program should then display how to provide that change to the user.

	In India:
		1 Rupee is 100 paise

	Here is a sample run:

	Enter an amount in rupee :  92

	You can provide this change as follows:
	dollars    : 0
	paise

	Feel free to use your own currency system.
	Also, think of how you might solve the problem using the modulo operator.

	Have fun and test your program!!
